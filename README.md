Simple Amiga Installer

I personally have a very soft spot in my heart for AmigaOS 3.1.
I always enjoy going back to it. What I do not enjoy is having
to do a fresh installation. When you had your system set up
"just so" back in the day, a rushed setup just will not do when
you want to showcase the beauty that was AmigaOS to your colleagues.

So I came up with the idea to write an Installer script to do
it all -- including all the icon imagery and positioning, prefs,
everything.

This is an attempt to do just that.
