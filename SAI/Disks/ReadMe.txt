If you want to (significantly) speed up future installations using
the Simple Amiga Installer, copy the six Workbench installation
floppies here (so this drawer contains "Workbench3.1", "Extras3.1"
and so on). SAI will read their data from here instead of asking
you to insert the floppy disks during each installation run.
