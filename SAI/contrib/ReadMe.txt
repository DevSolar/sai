To function properly, SAI needs some tools that are not available from the
Amiga installation disks, and would have to be downloaded from Aminet.

To simplify the process, these are included in the SAI distribution.

These tools have been taken from the following Aminet archives:

comm/tcp/GetClient14.lha
dev/misc/patch-2.1.lha
util/arc/lha.run
util/misc/Installer-43_3.lha
